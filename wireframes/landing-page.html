      <p>
        Real estate investment decisions should always begin with proper due diligence.

        This app is meant to be used by investors to discover and evaluate key statistics

      <h4>Get marketplace statistics</h4>
      <p>
        The app produces statistical data primarily on two geographic levels: 
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Metropolitan Statistical Areas:</strong> geographic 
            regions centered around areas of high population density (i.e., big cities) 
            with integrated economies
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Census Tracts:</strong> a small, focused geographic unit used for 
            statistical purposes by the US Census Bureau, often correlating closely to 
            city town boundaries.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
