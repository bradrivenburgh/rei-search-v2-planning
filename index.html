      <h3>About rei-search</h3>
      <p>
        Real estate investment decisions should always begin with proper due diligence.

        This app is meant to be used by investors interested in buying rental real estate 
        in and around Philadelphia, PA.  Users will be able to discover and evaluate key 
        statistics about the population and economy of municipalities in this geography.
        They will also be able to view properties for sale and catalogue them for later 
        viewing.

      <h4>Get marketplace statistics</h4>
      <p>
        The app produces statistical data primarily on two geographic levels: 
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area:
            </strong> MSAs are geographic regions centered around areas of high population density 
            (i.e., big cities) with integrated economies.  The Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, 
            PA-NJ-DE-MD MSA will provide investors with useful context when viewing comparable 
            Census Tract statistics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Census Tracts:</strong> a CT is a smaller geographic unit used for 
            statistical purposes by the US Census Bureau, often correlating closely to 
            city town boundaries.  The more granular focus will provide investors with a better
            idea of how a municipality compares to the MSA as a whole.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
